# AI Stock Prediction Project (Class 12)

This project implements a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** model to analyze stock market data.  
It was created as part of my **Class 12 AI coursework** and demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to financial datasets.  

## Features
- Fetches stock market data using **Quandl**
- Preprocesses data with Pandas and NumPy
- Visualizes trends with Matplotlib
- Trains a **KNN model** to predict stock movement

## Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Quandl, Google Colab

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google colab  
2. Install dependencies (`pip install quandl`)  
3. Run all cells

 *This was my first AI project, built for learning and experimentation.*
